                <p><b>Overview:</b> I'm working with Dr. Mitchell Neilsen and Sandia National Labs on developing dam analysis software. My role is to develop the user interface in Java. Mainly, I'm developing a text editor plug-in to aid in the creation of input files.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> Not being told how things should be done has been a challenge for me. It's up to me how things will be implemented and up to this point, I've been used to following some set of instructions for projects. So I've spent a lot of time planning and setting up my own instructions.</p>
                <p><b>What I'm Learning:</b> I'm learning the ins and outs of Eclipse plug-in development.</p>

                <p><b>Overview:</b> On the user experience team, I had the opportunity to work alongside both designers and developers. Our team developed the web platform for the company's applications. One of the larger tasks I was assigned was implementing new designs for their tab control. I updated the existing design and created a minimal design option for developers on our platform. Then another project I was given was redesigning their home interface with the main addition being the ability to drag apps and widgets so the user could arrange them to their liking.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> Rapid prototyping was something I had to get used to. It didn't happen very often, but from time to time a feature I had been working on would be cut. I had to learn how to develop quickly so the team could decide if we were headed in the right direction.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> I learned a great deal in this position. I learned how to properly document my code, write <a href="http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/" target="_blank">good</a> Git commit messages, break down large problems, and prioritize work. I also became a better web developer as I learned more about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and how to debug web projects. Then I also learned several key concepts around intuitive design such as discoverability.</p>
