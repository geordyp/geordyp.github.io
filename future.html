                        <p>Hello friends. My name is Geordy Paul Williams. I'm a rising junior studying computer science at Kansas State University. Although I was born in southern California, my hometown is Overland Park, Kansas. My interests include video games, movies, music, podcasts and pretty much anything tech related. Feel free to checkout <a href="#">my blog</a> to read more about what interests me.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Currently I'm interning at Lexmark Enterprise Software (formerly Perceptive Software). Also, I'm in a program called CodeU which is run by Google. In CodeU, students sharpen their skills in computer science through technical development and mentorship to become better candidates for opportunities such as internships. Lastly, I'm building a user interface for dam analysis software as part of a research project at K-State.
