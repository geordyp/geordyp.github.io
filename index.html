                <h>Introduction</h>
                <p>Hello friends, my name is Geordy Paul Williams. I'm a junior studying software engineering at Kansas State University. Although I was born in southern California, my hometown is Overland Park, Kansas. My interests include video games, movies, music, podcasts and pretty much anything tech related. Feel free to check out <a href="http://geordypaul.blogspot.com" target="_blank">my blog</a> to read more about what interests me.</p>

                <h>What I'm up to These Days</h>
                <p>In my junior year at K-State, I'm taking a really awesome class called Software Architecture and Design (CIS 501) where we get to learn about things like design patterns and principles. I'm also maintaining the website for K-State’s chapter of NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) which can be found <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/nsbe" target=”_blank”>here</a>. Another project I’m working on is building a user interface for dam analysis software as part of a research project with K-State’s Department of Computing and Information Sciences and Sandia National Labs. Lastly, in my spare time, I'm hoping to make time for some android development. I have an idea for an app that gives users information about video games using the api available through <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/api/documentation" target=”_blank”>Giant Bomb</a>.</p>

                <h>Mission Statement</h>
                <p>My goal in life is to leave a positive, lasting impact on the world. I will use my strengths and talents responsibly to  serve those in need. Knowing that I don't need to see the whole staircase to take the next step, I will step through life as a man of faith, integrity and altruism.</p>
