                        <li>Analyzed, updated and improved monthly financial excel spreadsheets using Microsoft Excel</li>

                <p><b>Overview:</b> My summer at Community Living Opportunities was spent helping out the finance group in any way I could. One of the main responsibilities I took up was to ensure that data was being transferred correctly from paper to excel sheets.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> When working with important documents, I wasn't always sure what should and shouldn't change. To overcome that, I asked a lot of questions and kept an accurate record of changes.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> In this role I learned how to stay organized in the workplace. I juggled several responsibilities and my co-workers relied on me being able to pull up specific information quickly.</p>

                <br><div class="date">November 2012 - January 2013</div>
                <div class="resume">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Led two gym classes daily for kindergarten through fifth grade students</li>
                        <li>Developed and coordinated healthy and active activities for the students to participate in</li>
                        <li>Instructed, encouraged and motivated children to participate in activities</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><b>Overview:</b> Sky's the Limit Childcare was my first job. I started out as a volunteer reading with students after school. Eventually, I was brought on as a floater helping out the staff wherever I was needed then I was given the opportunity to lead gym classes.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> Learning how to lead the class was my biggest challenge. I've always considered myself to be introverted, so commanding the attention of a class was definitely an adjustment. It was extremely draining at first, but before long I was comfortable in the position.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> I definitely developed an ability to keep calm in hectic situations. I also learned to leave whatever I was going through at the door because the children were our top priority and maintaining a positive atmosphere was a must.</p>
