                <h>Introduction</h>
                <p>Hello friends, my name is Geordy Paul Williams. I'm a rising junior studying computer science at Kansas State University. Although I was born in southern California, my hometown is Overland Park, Kansas. My interests include video games, movies, music, podcasts and pretty much anything tech related. Feel free to check out <a href="https://geordypaul.blogspot.com">my blog</a> to read more about what interests me.</p>

                <h>What I'm up to These Days</h>
                <p>Currently I'm interning at Lexmark Enterprise Software (formerly Perceptive Software). Also, I'm in a program called CodeU which is run by Google. In CodeU, students sharpen their skills in computer science through technical development and mentorship to become better candidates for opportunities such as internships. Lastly, I'm building a user interface for dam analysis software as part of a research project at K-State. More information on what I'm working can be found in <a href="work/2015.html">Professional Experience</a>.</p>

                <p>My goal in life is to leave a positive, lasting impact on the world. I will use my strengths and talents responsibly to  serve those in need. Knowing that I don't need to see the whole staircase to take the next step, I will step through life as a man of faith, integrity and altruism.</p>
