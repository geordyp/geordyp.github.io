            <p>Overview: I'm working with Dr. Mitchell Neilsen and Sandia National Labs on developing dam analysis software. My role is to develop the user interface in Java. Mainly, I'm developing a text editor plug-in to aid in the creation of input files.</p>
            <p>Challenge: Not being told how things should be done has been a challenge for me. It's up to me how things will be implemented and up to this point, I've been used to following some set of instructions for projects. So I've spent a lot of time planning and setting up my own instructions.</p>
            <p>What I'm Learning: I'm learning the ins and outs of Eclipse plug-in development.</p>

            <p>Overview: One of the larger tasks I was assigned was implementing new designs for their tab control. I updated the existing design and created a minimal design option for developers on our platform. Then another project I was given was redesigning their home interface with the main addition being the ability to drag apps and widgets so the user could arrange them to their liking.</p>
            <p>Challenge: Rapid prototyping was something I had to get used to. It didn't happen very often, but from time to time a feature I had been working on would be cut. I had to learn how to develop quickly so the team could decide if we were headed in the right direction.</p>
            <p>What I Learned: I learned a great deal in this position. I learned how to properly document my code, write good Git commit messages, break down large problems, and prioritize work. I also became a better web developer as I learned more about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and how to debug web projects. Then I also learned several key concepts around intuitive design such as discoverability.</p>

          <div class="text--reg">
            <p>Overview: CodeU is an exclusive development program where students are provided various resources and opportunities to strengthen their programming skills. Under the guidence of a Google mentor, I completed technical exercises to practice for technical interviews. Then I also learned Android development and presented a group app project at Google's Mountain View, CA campus.</p>
            <p>Challenge: Collaboration was particularly challenging because my group had members in each time zone and each of us had full-time internships. GitHub was extremely helpful to our situation. In spite of difficulties, we were able to have a functioning app to present at the CodeU Summit on the Google Mountain View campus. We developed a video game information app that made us of GiantBomb's <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/api/documentation">free api.</a></p>
            <p>What I Learned: While the project felt somewhat like a failure because we didn't have a fully functional app, the amount I learned developing the app made it feel like a success. From our final project alone, I learned about Android, SQL, and RESTful web services. CodeU combined with my internship made for a full, but really fun summer. I don't know if I've ever learned so much in such a short period of time.</p>

            <p>Overview: I worked on a team completely composed of interns. On the team, I handled most of the web application development. I developed dummy apps to test our service platform and a docs app which compiled all the documentation of all the apps on the platform.</p>
            <p>Challenge: My biggest challenge was finally gaining an understanding of something, then needing to learn something else. I learned something new literally everyday. It was an excellent and rewarding experience.</p>
            <p>What I Learned: I learned a great deal about OSGi, how to use GitHub, unit and integration testing, agile development, JavaScript and much more. In particular, I enjoyed working with other developers on the same project which was a first for me.</p>

            <p>Overview: CIS 200 (Programming Fundamentals) is a Java course which goes over the principles of algorithm design and their application to procedural programming. The course also includes an introduction to arrays, classes and objects.</p>
            <p>Challenge: One of the challenges in this position was accommodating the student's different levels of understanding and methods of learning. One student may be much further along and need very little explanation while the student next to her may be using arrays for the first time and get a lot out of seeing how it works on pen and paper.</p>
            <p>What I Learned: The rewarding part was how much I learned. When you need to know enough about a concept to explain it to someone seeing it for the time, your understanding of it increases greatly. Similar to CIS 115, it's likely I learned more being a UTA for the course than when I was a student.</p>

These young people, between 7 and 17, learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and explore technology in an informal and creative environment. In addition to learning to code attendees meet like minded people and get to show off what they've been working on."</p>
            <p>My team has partnered with our college's chapter of ACM to bring a CoderDojo here in Manhattan, Kansas. We plan on hosting young students in our department's labs where they will be free to explore their interests in computer science under the guidance of our volunteer mentors.</p>

Through this program, I've gained some amazing experiences like our trip to Boston over spring break 2015 where we had the opportunity to meet with various organizations who were passionately serving needs they saw in their communities. Over my years in this program, my desire to serve has only grown and after I graduate, I fully intend to be an asset to not only whatever community I end up in, but also the community I grew up in.</p>
