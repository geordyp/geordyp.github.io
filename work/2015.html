                    <ul>
                        <li>Worked on technical exercises focusing on data structures and algorithms under the guidance of a Google engineer mentor</li>
                        <li>Completed Udacity’s <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853" target="_blank">Developing Android Apps</a> course</li>
                        <li>Developed a video game app remotely with 2 other students that gives information on recently released games</li>
                        <li>Traveled to Google in Mountain View, CA for technical development and to present our group's app</li>

                </div>
                
                <p><b>Overview:</b> CodeU is an exclusive development program where students are provided various opportunities to strengthen their programming skills.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> Collaboration was particularly challenging because my group had members in each time zone and each of us had full-time internships. GitHub was extremely helpful to our situation. In spite of difficulties, we were able to have a functioning app to present at the CodeU Summit on the Google Mountain View campus. We developed a video game information app that made us of GiantBomb’s <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/api/documentation" target="_blank">free api</a>.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> While the project felt somewhat like a failure because we didn’t have a fully functional app, the amount I learned developing the app made it feel like a success. From our final project alone, I learned about Android, SQL, and RESTful web services. CodeU combined with my internship made for a full, but really fun summer. I don’t know if I’ve ever learned so much in such a short period of time.</p>

                        <li>Developed software which bridged the gap between the front end and back end of our enterprise software</li>
                        <li>Created a solution which dynamically enables a consistent user interface across different software products</li>
                        <li>Programmed in Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML</li>
                        <li>Utilized Apache Maven and frameworks including Apache Felix OSGi, Less.js, Handlebars.js, and Node.js</li>
                        <li>Created unit and integration tests using JUnit</li>
                        <li>Developed in eclipse and utilized GitHub for version control</li>

                <p><b>Overview:</b> Utilizing OSGi, a modular system and service platform with dynamic components, we were developing a solution that would allow perceptive applications to be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and restarted without requiring a full system reboot. Alongside that, we implemented features such as views which allowed a system administrator to set what applications would be available at a specific URL address. For example, applications involving the HR process would be grouped under the same URL.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> My biggest challenge was finally gaining an understanding of something, then needing to learn something else. I learned something new literally everyday. It was an excellent and rewarding experience.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> I learned a great deal about OSGi, how to use GitHub, unit and integration testing, agile development, JavaScript and much more. In particular, I enjoyed working with other developers on the same project which was a first for me.</p>

                <br><div class="sub">Kansas State University | Department of Computing and Information Sciences</div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Assisted students in their Java labs 3 times a week</li>

                </div>
                
                <p><b>Overview:</b> CIS 200 (Programming Fundamentals) is a Java course which goes over the principles of algorithm design and their application to procedural programming. The course also includes an introduction to arrays, classes and objects.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> One of the challenges in this position was accommodating the student's different levels of understanding and methods of learning. One student may be much further along and need very little explanation while the student next to her may be using arrays for the first time and get a lot out of seeing how it works on pen and paper.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> The rewarding part was how much I learned. When you need to know enough about a concept to explain it to someone seeing it for the time, your understanding of it increases greatly. Similar to CIS 115, it's likely I learned more being a UTA for the course than when I was a student.</p>
