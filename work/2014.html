                <p>CIS 115 (Introduction to Computing Science) is a survey of computer science and its interaction with other disciplines incorporating historical development, theories and tools such as algorithm design and programming. As a UTA I had several responsibilities. I’d assist the professor with any activities he may have prepared for lecture, grade assignments and hold office hours to assist students. The assignments I graded included blogs, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> projects and various group projects such as papers and presentations. For blogs, students were assigned a topic on a weekly basis, which I would grade making sure it followed the topic, was the right length and was their original work. Then for projects, the professor would give the UTAs a rubric and we would essentially go through that adding points appropriately. One of the challenges I had in this position was figuring out the right amount of help to give to students. It was usually my goal to make sure the student kept thinking and problem solving. So rather than just give them the answer, I would ask them questions about their work to guide them to the answer.</p>

                <p>At Kansas City Southern Railway, I worked with their change management group. Essentially, anything that was going to change in information technology went through our team to ensure a smooth and safe transition. My project was related to availability management which deals with the availability of the various components within the business. We were interested in knowing how often we were down and unavailable to our customers and having a clear understanding as to what components lead to our downtime. My focus was on building a model that output availability percentages based on the uptime data for each IT component. So I’d set up meetings with heads of different business functions to create network diagrams and gain an understanding of all the dependencies of that function. Then since most of the data came in excel sheets, I learned how to write macros. I’d use that data as input then, based on the information I gathered from our meetings, I’d write functions that output the appropriate availability percentage for the business function. I learned a great deal of soft skills in this position like communicating effectively, setting up and leading meetings, and collaborating across disciplines.</p>

                <p>The Developing Scholars Program gives students research opportunities by pairing them with a professor who will mentor them through a project. For this year’s project, I was paired with a professor in data mining. The focus we agreed on was in recommender systems. Since this was the very beginning of my career, I knew little about writing code. So in the first semester, I read a lot of research papers about collaborative and content-based recommender systems and how companies like Amazon and Netflix use them to keep customers returning for more content. Then in the spring semester, while I was taking my first programming class (CIS 200, Programming Fundamentals) I began to build a UI for an open source project I found online that recommended movies to users based on user ratings (collaborative filtering). It was a fairly simple project. The UI grabbed 5 random movies from the text file and the user could select one they liked and I’d run the algorithm to get recommendations for them. Then there was a "randomize" button that refreshed the list to display more movies. It was a really tough project, but still hugely beneficial as I was developing this project while learning Java for the first time.</p>
