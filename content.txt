Hello friends, my name is Geordy Paul Williams. I'm a junior studying software engineering at Kansas State University. Although I was born in southern California, my hometown is Overland Park, Kansas. My interests include video games, movies, music, podcasts and pretty much anything tech related. Feel free to check out <a href="http://geordypaul.blogspot.com" target="_blank">my blog</a> to read more about what interests me.

Why Computer Science? (brief)
Growing up, I loved building with Legos and playing video games. I always enjoyed problem solving in video games and creating with Legos only limited by my imagination. These passions I developed for creativity and problem solving brought me into computer science. While in high school, I had the opportunity to visit K-State and meet with several of the professors and students in the computer science department. Hearing about The research and class projects people were working on were so interesting to me.
But what really sold me on computer science was the possibility of becoming a game developer. The best conversation I had on that visit was with a professor who taught game development. We had a great conversation about the industry, which was the first time I had engaged in a conversation about the videogame industry with an adult who didn’t work at GameStop.
After that conversation, I was incredibly excited to study computer science. All the possibilities available in the field
But it really wasn’t just that conversation. I was intrigued by the idea of using technology to solve problems that help people. I’d think about big questions like how can computer science make a city like Chicago safer for everyone.
With each class I’ve taken, I’ve been assured that it was the right decision as the excitement to learn never fades.


Why Computer Science?
Growing up, I loved building with Legos and playing video games. I always enjoyed problem solving in video games and creating with Legos only limited by my imagination. These passions I developed for creativity and problem solving brought me into computer science, but not immediately. My dad was a computer scientist, but by the time I was born he had switched careers. While his passions weren’t in the field anymore, he’d still point me toward computer science because he thought it’d be good fit for me, especially with all the opportunities available in the field.
I took my first programming class later in high school. What’s interesting is that I was actually somewhat discouraged from going into computer science after taking that class. I didn’t like how it was taught and everyone in my class was much further along than me. I visited K-State sometime after that class and got to meet with several professors and students in the computer science department.

Aspirations?
With my computer science degree, I hope to create innovative software that has a meaningful impact on people’s lives and solve issues where computer science is an unlikely tool like gun violence in Chicago for example. I aspire to leave a positive lasting impact on the world.
I aspire to become a video game developer and create games that do more than entertain. Video games that teach, improve people’s health or even produce solutions to world issues. A TED Talk by Jane McGonigal inspired me to think about games in this way. She shared how we as a planet spend 3 billion hours a week playing games. What if we could pool all those hours spent gaming into solving a global problem helping those in need? What if we were able to feed real world problems into games that the gamers could solve? These are wildly ambitious questions that I think are similar to the questions Googlers ask every day. At Google, there is an innovative and creative spirit that drives every project. Through their ambitious projects, Google engineers are able to change the world. The technical and professional development I would gain in a summer with Google would put me miles closer to realizing how my ambitious ideas could come to fruition. I have a ton to learn and there would be no better place to learn than Google. The people I’d learn from, the experiences I’d have, and the skills I’d acquire would be invaluable.

About Me
Kansas State University
4th Year Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science
Anticipated Graduation Date: May 2018
<p>I became interested the field because of my interest in video games. In high school, soccer and video games were (and still are) my favorite pastimes. But I didn’t just enjoy playing video games, I also had fun learning about how they were developed and the industry as a whole. My friends would tease me saying I read about video games a lot more than I actually played them. </p>
<p>When deciding my major, computer science was an obvious choice for me because even if I didn’t end up in the video game industry, the field as a whole was fascinating to me. Taking my first classes in college assured me I had picked the right major as it was the first time I was genuinely excited to learn in the classroom.</p>
<p>Today, what I enjoy most about computer science is how I get to work with my strengths in strategic thinking and problem solving along with my values in creativity and helping others.  Software has solved a lot of meaningful problems and as the field advances, I hope to be a part of some of those world impacting solutions.</ p>
What I’m Up To These Days
<p>For the summer, I’m interning at Lexmark Enterprise Software as a user experience developer working on web applications. Then alongside my academic coursework, I'm also maintaining the website for K-State’s chapter of NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) which can be found <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/nsbe" target=”_blank”>here</a>. Another project I’m working on is an Eclipse Rich Client Plug-in which will aid in the design and analysis of water control structures as part of a research project with K-State’s Department of Computing and Information Sciences and Sandia National Labs. Then I’m also in the early stages of starting a <a href=”https://coderdojo.com/” target=”_blank”>CoderDojo</a> in Manhattan, Kansas. Lastly, in my spare time, I'm enrolled in Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. I've been interested in building my skillset in web development and I couldn't be more excited to take part in this course where I'll get to learn how to build complex web applications.</p>
Career Objectives
<p>For this upcoming fall semester, I’m planning on continuing my research in cyber-physical systems, pursuing an internship for summer 2017, and exploring graduate school options. Although I’m working toward opportunities in software engineering, I’m also interested in user experience and full stack web development.<p>

RESUME
Work Experience
                <p><b>Overview:</b> On the user experience team, I had the opportunity to work alongside both designers and developers. Our team developed the web platform for the company’s applications. One of the larger tasks I was assigned was implementing new designs for their tab control. I updated the existing design and created a minimal design option for developers on our platform. Then another project I was given was redesigning their home interface with the main addition being the ability to drag apps and widgets so the user could arrange them to their liking.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> Rapid prototyping was something I had to get used to. It didn’t happen very often, but from time to time a feature I had been working on would be cut. I had to learn how to develop quickly so the team could decide if we were headed in the right direction.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> I learned a great deal in this position. I learned how to properly document my code, write <a href=”http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/” target=”_blank”>good</a> Git commit messages, break down large problems, and prioritize work. I also became a better web developer as I learned more about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and how to debug web projects. Then I also learned several key concepts around intuitive design such as discoverability.</p>
