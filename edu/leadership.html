                <p>When I was a child, my father worked for the National Center for Fathering, a nonprofit organization committed to strengthening the relationship between a father and his children. Growing up, it was normal to spend time outside of our suburbs in urban communities for fathering events facilitated by my father. So serving the urban community was something I had witness from an early age. Fast forward a few years and now I’m in Edgerley-Franklin Urban Leadership gaining the knowledge and experience to bring new solutions to our nation’s most pressing urban needs.</p>
                <p>To me, Edgerley-Franklin is about developing young leaders into influencers who won’t just live life, but be impactful with their lives. Through this program, I’ve gained some amazing experiences like our trip to Boston over spring break 2015 where we had the opportunity to meet with various organizations who were passionately serving needs they saw in their communities. Over my years in this program, my desire to serve has only grown and after I graduate, I fully intend to be an asset to not only whatever community I end up in, but also the community I grew up in.</p>

                <br><div class="date">August 2013 -</div>

                <p>The National Society of Black Engineers has allowed me to put some of my leadership ability to practice. Being a webmaster and historian, my roles aren’t as much on the leadership side, but that doesn’t hinder me from giving my input and helping the direction and reach of our organization. As a webmaster, I make sure I’m putting out my best work to hopefully attract potential members and keep our current members happy. I rolled out a new <a href="http://k-state.edu/nsbe" target="_blank">design</a> and made sure it was responsive so it could look as good on a phone as it does in the browser. I also make sure to keep the content updated so that members can always be assured that what they’re seeing is current.</p>

                <br><div class="sub"><i>Scholar</i> | Kansas State University, School of Leadership Studies</div>
                <br><div class="date">August 2013 - May 2014</div>

                <p>Being a part of Soaring with Eagles was huge for my development as a leader. I still remember early on in the class when all the students were going around talking about their involvement and leadership roles in high school and all I had going on outside of school was soccer. No executive positions or committees or clubs, just soccer. When I expressed my discomfort with the class to my high school club soccer coach (who has known me since elementary school) he assured me I belonged there as much as any of the other students and how he observed that I never needed a position to lead by example. Hearing that from him was a turning point for me and from there, the class developed me into the leader I am today. The big takeaway I have from being a part of Soaring with Eagles is the self-awareness I have toward my strengths in strategic thinking and my core values in faith, creativity, integrity and altruism. Knowing who I am and what I’m good at has been huge for my leadership ability because if I’m not firm in who I am, how could I be expected to lead others?</p>
