                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Kansas State University<br>4th Year Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science<br>Anticipated Graduation Date: May 2018</p>
                <p>I became interested the field because of my interest in video games. In high school, soccer and video games were (and still are) my favorite pastimes. But I didn't just enjoy playing video games, I also had fun learning about how they were developed and the industry as a whole. My friends would tease me saying I read about video games a lot more than I actually played them. </p>
                <p>When deciding my major, computer science was an obvious choice for me because even if I didn't end up in the video game industry, the field as a whole was fascinating to me. Taking my first classes in college assured me I had picked the right major as it was the first time I was genuinely excited to learn in the classroom.</p>
                <p>Today, what I enjoy most about computer science is how I get to work with my strengths in strategic thinking and problem solving along with my values in creativity and helping others.  Software has solved a lot of meaningful problems and as the field advances, I hope to be a part of some of those world impacting solutions.</p>

                <h1>What I'm Up To These Days</h1>
                <p>Alongside my academic coursework, I'm also maintaining the website for K-State's chapter of NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) which can be found <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/nsbe" target=”_blank”>here</a>. Another project I'm working on is an Eclipse text editor plug-in which will aid in the design and analysis of water control structures as part of a research project with K-State's Department of Computer Science and Sandia National Labs. Then I'm also in the early stages of starting a <a href=”https://coderdojo.com/” target=”_blank”>CoderDojo</a> in Manhattan, Kansas. We're set to launch in October! Lastly, in my spare time, I'm enrolled in Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. I've been interested in gaining some depth in web development and I couldn't be more excited to take part in this course where I'll get to learn how to build complex web applications.</p>
