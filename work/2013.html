                <p>My summer at Community Living Opportunities was spent helping out the finance group in any way I could. One of the main responsibilities I took up was to ensure that data was being transferred correctly from paper to excel sheets. So any month that didn’t balance, I would go through and analyze where it went wrong. Then I got their team back up to speed entering financial data all the way up to that summer. I also did some file organization and maintained the files for some of our clients. Some of the skills I worked on in this position were mental math, analysis and organization.</p>

                <p>Sky’s the Limit Childcare was my first job. It started out a volunteer opportunity that would contribute to my hours for National Honors Society. I would come to their after school program and read with some of the students. Then I was brought on as a floater helping out the staff wherever I was needed. I helped with snack time, the homework room and evening the odds on the video games. It wasn’t long before I was brought on as a gym teacher where I’d lead two gym classes daily for students ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade. I experienced a lot working with all kinds of children from those who had a hard time making good decisions to those who were too “cool” to participate. I definitely developed an ability to keep calm in hectic situations. I also learned to leave whatever I was going through at the door because the children were our top priority and maintaining a positive atmosphere was a must.</p>
