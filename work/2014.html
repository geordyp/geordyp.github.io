                    <ul>
                        <li>Attended lectures and assisted students with in-class work</li>
                        <li>Graded weekly blog and programming assignments</li>

                <p><b>Overview:</b> CIS 115 (Introduction to Computing Science) is a survey of computer science and its interaction with other disciplines incorporating historical development, theories and tools such as algorithm design and programming.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> One of the challenges I had in this position was figuring out the right amount of help to give to students. It was usually my goal to make sure the student kept thinking and problem solving. So rather than just give them the answer, I would ask them questions about their work to guide them to the answer.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> I learned a great deal participating in the class a year after I took it. Many concepts I never grasped, I learned through teaching other students.</p>

                        <li>Met with application and system owners to define IT provided business services for the purpose of measuring availability</li>
                        <li>Setup and led meetings with engineers and architects to map out underlying IT components</li>
                        <li>Built an availability model based on theoretical data using VBA macros and tested the model with actual data</li>

                </div>
                
                <p><b>Overview:</b> My project was related to availability management which deals with the availability of the various components within the business. We were interested in knowing how often we were down and unavailable to our customers and having a clear understanding as to what IT components lead to our downtime.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> Sometimes in class, students can be so lost that they don’t even know what questions to ask. Having only completed my freshmen year, I had a lot to learn and I had to learn it very quickly to be able to participate and eventually lead meetings with engineers.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> I learned a great deal of soft skills in this position like communicating effectively, setting up and leading meetings, and collaborating across disciplines.</p>

                <br><div class="date">August 2013 - May 2014</div>
                <div class="resume">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducted research on recommender systems with a faculty mentor in the computer science department</li>
                        <li>Research title: “Using Recommender Systems for Social Network Applications”</li>
                        <li>Developed the UI for a collaborative filtering recommender system for movies using Java and Mahout</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p><b>Overview:</b> The Developing Scholars Program gives students research opportunities by pairing them with a professor who will mentor them through a project. I was paired with a professor in data mining. The focus I chose was in recommender systems. Specifically, collaborative and content-based recommender systems that companies like Amazon and Netflix use to keep customers returning for more content.</p>
                <p><b>Challenge:</b> The challenge came from trying to develop the project while learning Java for the first time. Working on this project outside of class definitely helped me learn Java quickly.</p>
                <p><b>What I Learned:</b> I learned to be resourceful as my research professor’s availability was limited. To overcome a lot of challenges I had to reach out to other professors and do a lot of Google searching.</p>
