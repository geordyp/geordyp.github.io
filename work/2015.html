                <p>I'm working with Dr. Mitchell Neilsen and Sandia National Labs on developing dam analysis software. My role is developing the user interface in Java. The most exciting challenge I've yet to tackle is creating the text editor with several features like autocompletion which will ease the creation of input files. Down the line, we hope to add graphics to help visualize the output data.</p>

                <p>At Lexmark (formerly Perceptive Software) I worked in the finance process automation (FPA) group. Within that group I was on a team comprised of interns. We had a scrum master, product manager, technical writers and 3 developers. Our team was developing a project that had been on the FPA group's backlog. Utilizing OSGi, a modular system and service platform with dynamic components, we were developing a solution that would allow perceptive applications to be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and restarted without requiring a full system reboot. Alongside that, we implemented features such as views which allowed a system administrator to set what applications would be available at a specific URL address. For example, applications involving the HR process would be grouped under the same URL. I worked in Java, JavaScript and some HTML and CSS. I learned a great deal about OSGi, how to use GitHub, unit and integration testing, agile development, JavaScript and much more. In particular, I enjoyed working with other developers on the same project which was a first for me. My biggest challenge was finally gaining an understanding of something, then needing to learn something else. I learned something new literally everyday. It was an excellent and rewarding experience.</p>

                <p>CIS 200 (Programming Fundamentals) is a Java course which goes over the principles of algorithm design and their application to procedural programming. The course also includes an introduction to arrays, classes and objects. It's a fair amount of student's first time actually writing code. CIS 200 is comprised of lectures and a weekly lab. I was a UTA for 3 labs a week helping the GTA. One of the challenges in this position was accommodating the student's different levels of understanding and methods of learning. One student may be much further along and need very little explanation while the student next to her may be using arrays for the first time and get a lot out of seeing how it works on pen and paper. The rewarding part was how much I learned. When you need to know enough about a concept to explain it to someone seeing it for the time, your understanding of it increases greatly. It's likely I learned more being a UTA for the course than when I was a student.</p>
