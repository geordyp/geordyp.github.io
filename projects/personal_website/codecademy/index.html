                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Hello friends, my name is <b>Geordy Paul Williams</b>. I'm a <b>junior</b> studying <b>software engineering</b> at <b>Kansas State University</b>. I became interested in computer science because of my interest in video games. In high school, soccer and video games were (and still are) my favorite pastimes. But I didn’t just enjoy playing video games, I also had fun learning about how they were developed and the industry as a whole. My friends would tease me saying I read about video games a lot more than I actually played them. </p>
                <p>When deciding my major, computer science was an obvious choice for me because even if I didn’t end up in the video game industry, the field as a whole was fascinating to me. Taking my first classes in college assured me computer science was the field for me as it was the first time I was genuinely excited to learn in the classroom.</p>
                <p>Today, what I enjoy most about computer science is how I get to work with my strengths in strategic thinking and problem solving along with my values in creativity and helping others.  Software has solved a lot of meaningful problems and as the field advances, I hope to be a part of some of those world impacting solutions.</ p>

                <h1>What I'm Up To These Days</h1>
                <p>Alongside my academic coursework, I'm also maintaining the website for K-State’s chapter of NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) which can be found <a href="javascript:void(0)" target=”_blank”>here</a>. Another project I’m working on is an Eclipse plug-in which will aid in the design and analysis of water control structures as part of a research project with K-State’s Department of Computing and Information Sciences and Sandia National Labs. Lastly, in my spare time, I'm enrolled in Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. I've been interested in gaining some depth in web development and I couldn't be more excited to take part in this course where I'll get to learn how to build complex web applications.</p>
