                <p>At Lexmark (formerly Perceptive Software) I'm working in the finance process automation (FPA) group. Within that group I'm on a team comprised of interns. We have a scrum master, product manager, technical writers and 3 developers. Our team is developing a project that has been on the FPA group's backlog. Utilizing OSGi, a modular system and service platform with dynamic components, we are developing a solution which will allow perceptive applications to be accessible through the browser and remotely install, start, stop, update, and restart without requiring a full system reboot. I'm working in java, javascript and some html and css. I've learned a great deal about OSGi, how to use GitHub, unit and integration testing, agile development and much more. In particular, I enjoy working with other developers on the same project which is a first for me. My biggest challenge has been finally gaining an understanding of something, then needing to learn something else. I learn something new literally everyday. It's been an excellent and rewarding experience.</p>

                <p>I'm working with Dr. Mitchell Neilsen and Sandia National Labs on developing dam analysis software. My role is developing the user interface. I'm developing it in C# Visual Studio. The most exciting challenge I've yet to tackle is creating the text editor with several features like autocompletion which will ease the creation of input files. Down the line, we hope to add graphics to help visualize the output data.</p>

                <p>CIS 200 (Programming Fundamentals) is a Java course which goes over the principles of algorithm design and their application to procedural programming. The course also includes an introduction to arrays, classes and objects. It's a fair amount of student's first time actually writing code. CIS 200 is comprised of lectures and a weekly lab. I was a UTA for 3 labs a week helping the GTA. One of the challenges in this position was accommodating the student's different levels of understanding and methods of learning. One student may be much further along and need very little explanation while the student next to her may be using arrays for the first time and get a lot out of seeing how it works on pen and paper. The rewarding part was how much I learned. When you need to know enough about a concept to explain it to someone seeing it for the time, your understanding of it increases greatly. It's likely I learned more being a UTA for the course than when I was a student.</p>
