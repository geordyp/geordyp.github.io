                <p>I'm working with Dr. Mitchell Neilsen and Sandia National Labs on developing dam analysis software. My role is to develop the user interface in Java. Mainly, I’m developing a text editor to aid in the creation of input files. We’re currently planning on having a helper pane which will parse the editor and display relevant information to the user such as the parameters expected or keywords the user may enter next. Down the line, we hope to add graphics to help visualize the output data. Also, I’m looking into developing an eclipse plugin which will have many of the features available in our text editor.</p>

                <p>CodeU is an exclusive development program where students are provided various opportunities to strengthen their programming skills. The main component was the mentorship I received from a Google engineer. We would connect every other week to discuss career development as a software engineer. Then there was the technical development which was in the form of programming questions similar to those found in technical interviews. On top of that, when the summer began, I took Udacity’s <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853" target="_blank">Developing Android Apps</a> course and then created an original Android app with a group of students who shared my Google mentor. Collaboration was particularly challenging because my group had members in each time zone and each of us had full-time internships. GitHub was extremely helpful to our situation. In spite of difficulties, we were able to have a functioning app to present at the CodeU Summit on the Google Mountain View campus. We developed a video game information app that made us of GiantBomb’s <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/api/documentation" target="_blank">free api</a>. While the project felt somewhat like a failure because we didn’t have a fully functional app, the amount I learned developing the app made it feel like a success. CodeU combined with my internship made for a full, but really fun summer. I don’t know if I’ve ever learned so much in such a short period of time.</p>

                <p>At Lexmark (formerly Perceptive Software) I worked in the finance process automation (FPA) group. Within that group I was on a team comprised of interns. We had a scrum master, product manager, technical writers and 3 developers. Our team was developing a project that had been on the FPA group's backlog. Utilizing OSGi, a modular system and service platform with dynamic components, we were developing a solution that would allow perceptive applications to be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and restarted without requiring a full system reboot. Alongside that, we implemented features such as views which allowed a system administrator to set what applications would be available at a specific URL address. For example, applications involving the HR process would be grouped under the same URL. I worked in Java, JavaScript and some HTML and CSS. I learned a great deal about OSGi, how to use GitHub, unit and integration testing, agile development, JavaScript and much more. In particular, I enjoyed working with other developers on the same project which was a first for me. My biggest challenge was finally gaining an understanding of something, then needing to learn something else. I learned something new literally everyday. It was an excellent and rewarding experience.</p>

                <p>CIS 200 (Programming Fundamentals) is a Java course which goes over the principles of algorithm design and their application to procedural programming. The course also includes an introduction to arrays, classes and objects. It's a fair amount of student's first time actually writing code. CIS 200 is comprised of lectures and a weekly lab. I was a UTA for 3 labs a week helping the GTA. One of the challenges in this position was accommodating the student's different levels of understanding and methods of learning. One student may be much further along and need very little explanation while the student next to her may be using arrays for the first time and get a lot out of seeing how it works on pen and paper. The rewarding part was how much I learned. When you need to know enough about a concept to explain it to someone seeing it for the time, your understanding of it increases greatly. It's likely I learned more being a UTA for the course than when I was a student.</p>
